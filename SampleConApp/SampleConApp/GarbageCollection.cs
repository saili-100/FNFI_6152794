//Garbage Collection is an internal memory management system of .NET framework. It is used to manage the memory of the application and ensures that unused objects/memory is removed behind the scenes as and when its required. 
//Garbage collection is recommended not to be touched unless U R working with unmanaged code. Code developed with traditional C/C++ and outside the world of .NET is called as Unmanaged code. Code that is executed in .NET is managed by CLR and GC, hense its called as Managed Code/Environment. 
//Traditional C/C++ does not have automatic memory management as far as dynamic memory allocation is concerned. 
//Destructors are sp function called when the object is destroyed in the memory. It is opposite of Constructor which is called when the object is created. objects can be created using new operator in C#, however, we dont have any deletion operator in C# as it is expected to be done internally by GC thru .NET CLR.  
//To explicitly call destructors of unmanaged code, .NET recommends to implement an interface called IDisposable which has a function called Dispose and call the unmanaged destructors in it. The programmers must called the Dispose method if the object is no longer needed and avoid memory leaks. 
//IDisposable interface is used to implement Dispose method that shall be called explicitly by the programmers after the usage of an object. 
//using block helps in calling the Dispose method implicitly after the object goes out of scope.
