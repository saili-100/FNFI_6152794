        Nanded, the city that features the beguiling blend of modern with the ancient form, is the second biggest city of Maharashtra and is also the head quarters of the district which bears the same name of the city. 
        It is situated in the southeast part of Maharashtra along the banks of River Godavari in the Marathwada region.
        This Maharashtra city is a well known place of historical importance as it houses the popular Sikh Gurudwara and many other Sufi shrines. 
        The presence of Hazur Sahib, which is one among the five Takhtas of Sikhs, makes Nanded the second most holy city among the Sikhs, following Amritsar in the lead. 
        In spite of being a religious city, Nanded has evolved as a promising commercial sector of Maharashtra. 
        Most of the industries of Nanded are based on agricultural produce and others are units manufacturing steel furniture.
